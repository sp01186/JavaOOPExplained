OOP four pillars

OOP - programming bases around the concept of objects

Objects - contains data in the form of properties and methods

Every class extends Object.

A PIE

Abstraction - hide away the implementation details from
the user



Polymorphism - Ability of a class to run a method in two
or more different ways.

poly = many, morph = forms


Inheritance - encourages code re-usability by letting one
object acquire the properties and methods of another object

IS a relationship

sub class has an IS a relationship with the super class. E.g ford fiesta is a car.
Super class / parent class / base class
                                    < -
                                        sub class / child class / extended

Encapsulation - Built on the idea of data hiding
               -we restrict access to certain properties or methods of an object to
               whatever is calling it

   private access properties

   accessed through getter and setter.
